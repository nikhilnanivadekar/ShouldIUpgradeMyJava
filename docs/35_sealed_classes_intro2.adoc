== Sealed Classes (JDK 17) - Intro

** With sealed classes we get the following modifiers and clauses
*** `sealed`: can be extended of implemented only by those classes and interfaces permitted to do so
*** `non-sealed`: allows to open up a part of the hierarchy without exposing the entire hierarchy
*** `permits`: specifies the subclasses that can extend the sealed class
** If subclasses are in different files in the same module or package, then use `permits` to define the subclasses that may extend the sealed class
** If subclasses are in the same file as `sealed` superclass, then `permits` clause is not needed
