== Garbage Collectors

** Serial GC (JDK 1)
*** Simplest and the oldest GC mainly designed for a single thread environment
*** Uses a single thread for garbage collection
*** Not a good idea to use it in multi-threaded applications like server environments

** Parallel GC (JDK 1.4)
*** Uses multiple threads for garbage collection
*** Freezes all application threads while performing garbage collection (similar to Serial GC)

** CMS GC (Removed in JDK 14)
*** Uses multiple GC threads for garbage collection
*** Removed in JDK 14

** G1 GC (JDK 8)
*** Partitions heap in to set of equal sized heap regions and performs garbage collection within them in parallel
*** Stands for Garbage First (G1)

** ZGC (JDK 16)
*** Performs work concurrently in it's own threads without stopping execution of application threads for more than 10 ms
*** Suitable for low latency, very large heap (multi-terabytes)

** Shenandoah GC (JDK 17 / JDK 11.0.14)
*** Ultra low pause time GC
*** Processing happens in multiple small phases mostly concurrent with the application
*** Aggressively compacts the heap in parallel with application threads
*** Provides a variety of tuning options to configure GC behavior based on application needs

** Epsilon (Experimental as of Sept 2022)
*** Passive garbage collector: Allocates the memory but does not collect unused objects
*** Epsilon GC allows applications to run out of memory and crash
