== Text Blocks (JDK 15)

** Text blocks provide clarity by minimizing Java syntax required for a `string` that spans multiple lines
** Prior to JDK 15, developers had to deal with non-maintainable string concatenations and delimiters when they worked with strings that spanned across multiple lines
** Text block is an alternative representation of `string`, hence has all characteristics of `java.lang.String`
** Text block can be used to improve readability and clarity of code
