// Since Resident is non-sealed, it is open for any number of sub-classes, hence it opens up the hierarchy
public final class DayGuest extends Resident {

public final class OvernightGuest extends Resident {
}
// These tests passed
Assertions.assertEquals("Logged in", dayGuest.login());
Assertions.assertEquals("Logged in", overnightGuest.login());
