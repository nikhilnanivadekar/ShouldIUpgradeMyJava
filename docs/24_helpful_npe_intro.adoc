== Helpful Null Pointer Exceptions (JDK 14)

** Prior to Java 14, it was difficult to isolate a null pointer exception in chained method calls
** From Java 14 `NullPointerException` prints a detailed message comprised of the failed operation and the cause of the failure
** The detailed message is provided only when the JVM throws a NPE and not when an NPE is explicitly thrown
