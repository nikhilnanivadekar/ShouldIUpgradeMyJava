== Memory Tests - Intro

* Create a trivial program which loops 5 times and measure memory used after each iteration
* For sake of representation only the memory after 5 iterations is reported
* Measure Reported in Kb: `Used Memory = Total Memory - Free Memory`
* _Smaller_ numbers are better
* 4 Core Intel i5 Processor
* Your Mileage May Vary (YMMV)
** _Please test, benchmark and profile your application._
